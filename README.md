## Installation

To use the SiteGround Speed Optimizer Config Saver, you need to add it to your GitHub Actions workflow. Follow these steps:

2. Use the following code snippet to set up the action:

```yaml
name: Save SiteGround Config

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  save-config:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Save SiteGround Speed Optimizer Config
        uses: BigSpace52/github-action-siteground-speed-optimizer-config-saver@v1.0.0
        with:

```

3. Ensure you have the necessary API key stored in your repository secrets.

## Usage

Once the action is set up, it will run automatically on every push to the `main` branch. If you want to run it on different events, adjust the `on` section in your workflow file accordingly.

### Triggering the Action

You can trigger the action manually or through scheduled events. To run the action manually, you can use the "Run workflow" button in the GitHub Actions tab of your repository.
